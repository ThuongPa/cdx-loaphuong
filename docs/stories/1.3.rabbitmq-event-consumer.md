# Story 1.3: RabbitMQ Event Consumer

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria implemented and tested

## Story

**As a** Backend Developer,  
**I want** to implement RabbitMQ consumer to receive notification events from microservices,  
**So that** service can process and send notifications when events occur.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **RabbitMQ Consumer Service**: NestJS service to consume messages:
   - Subscribe to `notifications.exchange` topic exchange
   - Handle routing keys: `feedback.{eventType}` (from Feedback Service) and `auth.{eventType}` (from Auth Service if available)
   - Message deserialization and validation
   - Acknowledgment and error handling
   - Dead letter queue for failed messages

2. **Event Handlers**: Handlers for different event types:
   - Feedback events (`feedback.FeedbackCreatedEvent`, `feedback.FeedbackSubmittedEvent`)
   - Status change events (`feedback.StatusChangedEvent`)
   - Assignment events (`feedback.FeedbackAssignedEvent`, `feedback.AssignmentCreatedEvent`)
   - Comment events (`feedback.CommentAddedEvent`)
   - SLA events (`feedback.SLABreachedEvent`, `feedback.SLAWarningEvent`)
   - Resolution events (`feedback.FeedbackResolvedEvent`, `feedback.FeedbackClosedEvent`)
   - Auth Service events (if available - user role changes, user updates)

3. **Event Schema Validation**: Validate incoming events with defined schema:
   - Required fields: `eventId`, `eventType`, `aggregateId`, `aggregateType`, `timestamp`, `payload`
   - Optional fields: `correlationId`, `metadata`
   - Payload structure varies by event type (FeedbackCreatedEvent, StatusChangedEvent, etc.)

4. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry for failed messages:
   - Max retries: 3
   - Backoff: 100ms, 500ms, 2000ms
   - Move to DLQ after max retries

5. **Monitoring**: Log all events with correlation IDs for tracing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.1 established the basic NestJS project structure with DDD + CQRS patterns
- Story 1.2 implemented Novu client integration with circuit breaker pattern
- MongoDB schemas are already defined for users, device tokens, and notifications
- Infrastructure layer is set up with Mongoose, Redis, and RabbitMQ services
- **RabbitMQ infrastructure is already configured** - `notifications.exchange` topic exchange already exists

### Data Models

Based on architecture documents and event integration guide, the following data models are relevant:

- **Domain Event Schema**: Standardized event structure from Feedback Service with eventId, eventType, aggregateId, aggregateType, timestamp, payload [Source: event integration guide]
- **User Model**: Contains email, phone, roles for event targeting [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-model]
- **Announcement Model**: Stores notification content and metadata [Source: architecture/data-models.md#announcement-model]
- **Feedback Event Payloads**: Specific payload structures for each event type (FeedbackCreatedEvent, StatusChangedEvent, etc.)

### API Specifications

**RabbitMQ Integration:**

- Exchange: `notifications.exchange` (topic exchange) - **ALREADY EXISTS** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#rabbitmq-integration]
- Routing Keys: `feedback.{eventType}` pattern (from Feedback Service) [Source: event integration guide]
- Message Format: JSON with eventId, eventType, aggregateId, aggregateType, timestamp, payload, correlationId
- Dead Letter Queue: `notifications.dlq` for failed messages (needs to be created)
- Connection Management: Connection pooling with automatic reconnection
- Integration Notes: Use circuit breaker pattern, implement retry logic with exponential backoff, validate message schema

### Component Specifications

**RabbitMQ Consumer Service Location:**

- File: `src/infrastructure/messaging/rabbitmq.service.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#infrastructure-messaging-rabbitmq]
- Module: `src/infrastructure/messaging/rabbitmq.module.ts`
- Event Handlers: `src/modules/notification/integration/rabbitmq/event-handlers/`
- Consumer Module: `src/modules/notification/integration/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consumer.module.ts`

**Service Structure:**

- Connection management with RabbitMQ cluster
- Message deserialization and validation
- Event handler routing and execution
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue handling
- Monitoring and logging with correlation IDs

### File Locations

Based on project structure:

- RabbitMQ service: `src/infrastructure/messaging/rabbitmq.service.ts`
- RabbitMQ module: `src/infrastructure/messaging/rabbitmq.module.ts`
- Event consumer: `src/modules/notification/integration/rabbitmq/notification-event.consumer.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Standards:**

- Framework: Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- File Convention: `*.spec.ts` for unit tests, co-located with source files
- Location: Mirror source structure in `test/unit/` directory
- Coverage Requirement: 80% minimum, 90% for domain layer
- Mocking: Jest built-in mocking with custom mocks for external services

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards:**

- All external API calls must have circuit breaker protection [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Never use console.log in production code - Always use Winston logger
- Use dependency injection pattern - NestJS standard
- Async/await preferred over Promises
- Use CUID for all entity IDs

**Environment Configuration:**

- `RABBITMQ_URL`: RabbitMQ connection URL
- `RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE`: Exchange name (notifications.exchange)
- `RABBITMQ_DLQ`: Dead letter queue name
- `RABBITMQ_RETRY_COUNT`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
- `RABBITMQ_RETRY_DELAYS`: Retry delay intervals (100,500,2000)

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Consumer connects successfully with RabbitMQ cluster
- IV2: Test event consumption with mock Feedback Service events successfully
- IV3: DLQ receives failed messages after max retries
- IV4: Event handlers are triggered correctly for each feedback event type
- IV5: Event schema validation works for all Feedback Service event types

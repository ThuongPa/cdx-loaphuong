# Story 3.3: Deployment & Monitoring

## Status

âœ… **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** - All requirements identified and ready for implementation

## Story

**As a** DevOps Engineer,  
**I want** deployment configuration and monitoring setup,  
**So that** service can be deployed reliably and monitored in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Dockerfile multi-stage build
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Coolify configuration file
   - Environment variables documentation
   - MongoDB migration scripts

2. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Prometheus metrics endpoints
   - Health check endpoints
   - Grafana dashboard configuration
   - Log aggregation setup

3. **Queue Monitoring API**:
   - Queue status endpoint (`GET /api/v1/queue-status`)
   - Real-time queue metrics (queue length, processing status, circuit breaker state)
   - Performance metrics (total processed, success rate, average processing time)
   - Priority breakdown by notification level

4. **Batch Processing & Deduplication**:
   - Batch processing service for high-volume notifications
   - Deduplication service to prevent duplicate notifications
   - Batch optimization for database operations
   - Redis-based deduplication cache

5. **Priority Queue System**:
   - Priority queue service with 5 parallel workers
   - Worker pool management service
   - Redis persistence for zero data loss
   - Queue recovery service from Redis backup

6. **Enhanced Security Features**:
   - Rate limiting implementation (1000 req/min user, 100 req/min admin)
   - Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - OWASP ZAP integration in CI/CD

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - MongoDB bulk operations for batch processing
   - Redis caching optimization
   - Connection pooling for external services
   - Horizontal scaling support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.2 (Testing & Documentation):

- Comprehensive testing infrastructure is established
- API documentation is complete
- Code quality standards are implemented
- All testing patterns are ready for deployment and monitoring

### Infrastructure and Deployment

[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]

**Deployment Strategy:**

- **Tool:** Docker + Kubernetes + Coolify
- **Strategy:** Blue-Green deployment with rolling updates
- **CI/CD Platform:** Coolify with Git integration
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `infrastructure/coolify/coolify.json`

**Environment Promotion Flow:**

1. Code committed to main branch
2. Coolify detects changes via Git webhook
3. Automatic build and deployment to staging
4. Staging tests and validation
5. Manual approval for production deployment
6. Blue-green deployment to production
7. Health checks and rollback capability

**Rollback Strategy:**

- **Primary Method:** Blue-green deployment with instant rollback capability
- **Trigger Conditions:** Health check failures, error rate > 5%, response time > 2s
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 2 minutes

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Deployment Technologies:**

- **Container:** Docker Latest
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes 1.28+
- **Deployment Platform:** Coolify Latest
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

### Source Tree Structure

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Infrastructure Configuration:**

- Docker configuration: `infrastructure/docker/`
- Kubernetes manifests: `infrastructure/kubernetes/`
- Coolify configuration: `infrastructure/coolify/`
- Database scripts: `scripts/migrations/` and `scripts/seed/`

**New Components to Implement:**

- Queue monitoring: `src/modules/notification/queue-monitoring/`
- Batch processing: `src/modules/notification/batch-processing/`
- Priority queue: `src/modules/notification/priority-queue/`
- Security enhancements: `src/common/security/`
- Performance optimization: `src/infrastructure/performance/`

### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- All external API calls must have circuit breaker protection
- Never use console.log - use Winston logger
- All API responses must use ApiResponse wrapper type
- Database queries must use repository pattern
- All database operations must use transactions for multi-document updates

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- Jest 29.7.0 with test files co-located (`.spec.ts`, `.test.ts`)
- Unit tests for domain logic and services
- Integration tests with Testcontainers for database operations
- Mock external API calls (Novu, Auth Service)
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Test circuit breaker behavior

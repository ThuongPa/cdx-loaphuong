### Technical Constraints

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- Use CUID for all entity IDs (never MongoDB ObjectId)
- All external API calls must have circuit breaker protection
- All database operations must use transactions for multi-document updates
- Never use console.log - use Winston logger
- All API responses must use ApiResponse wrapper type
- All advanced features must respect user preferences and GDPR compliance

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:

- Jest 29.7.0 with test files co-located (`.spec.ts`, `.test.ts`)
- Unit tests for domain logic and services
- Integration tests with Testcontainers for database operations
- Mock external API calls (Novu, Auth Service)
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Test circuit breaker behavior
- Test all advanced features with comprehensive scenarios

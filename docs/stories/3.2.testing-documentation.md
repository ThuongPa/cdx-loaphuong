## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 (Admin Dashboard APIs):

- Admin functionality is complete with comprehensive testing
- Test structure follows Jest with co-located `.spec.ts` files
- Integration tests use proper mocking for external services
- Test coverage patterns established for controllers and services

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Framework & Organization:**

- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support
- **File Convention:** `*.spec.ts` for unit tests, co-located with source files
- **Location:** Mirror source structure in `test/unit/` directory
- **Coverage Requirement:** 80% minimum overall, 90% for domain layer
- **Test Pyramid:** 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% e2e tests

**Unit Test Requirements:**

- Generate tests for all public methods
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock all external dependencies (Novu, Auth Service, RabbitMQ)
- Test file location: Co-located with source files as `*.spec.ts`

**Integration Test Infrastructure:**

- **MongoDB:** Testcontainers MongoDB for isolated database testing
- **Redis:** Embedded Redis server for cache testing
- **RabbitMQ:** Testcontainers RabbitMQ for message queue testing
- **External APIs:** WireMock for Novu and Auth Service API stubbing
- **Location:** `test/integration/` directory

**E2E Test Framework:**

- **Framework:** Jest with supertest for API testing
- **Environment:** Docker Compose test environment with all dependencies
- **Test Data:** Factory-generated test data with cleanup after each test
- **Location:** `test/e2e/` directory

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Technologies:**

- **Testing Framework:** Jest 29.7.0
- **Container Testing:** Testcontainers for MongoDB and RabbitMQ
- **API Testing:** Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- **Mocking:** Jest built-in mocking with custom mocks for external services

### Source Tree Structure

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Test File Locations:**

- Unit tests: Co-located with source files as `*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `test/integration/` directory
- E2E tests: `test/e2e/` directory
- Test factories: `test/factories/` directory
- Test fixtures: `test/fixtures/` directory

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Testing Rules:**

- **Never use console.log in production code** - Always use Winston logger with appropriate log levels
- **All API responses must use ApiResponse wrapper type** - Consistent response format across all endpoints
- **Database queries must use repository pattern** - Never direct Mongoose calls outside repository layer
- **All external API calls must have circuit breaker protection** - Prevent cascading failures

**Test Organization:**

- **Test files co-located** (`.spec.ts`, `.test.ts`)
- **Jest 29.7.0** with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Factory pattern** for test data generation
- **Automatic cleanup** after each test with database truncation

### Testing Requirements

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#testing-structure]:

- **Unit Tests**: `test/unit/modules/notification/`
- **Integration Tests**: `test/integration/api/`
- **E2E Tests**: `test/e2e/`
- **Test Factories**: `test/factories/`
- **Test Fixtures**: `test/fixtures/`

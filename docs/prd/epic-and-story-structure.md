# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Epic** for Notification Service

**Rationale**:
Notification Service is a new microservice with a clear bounded context - notification management. Although it has multiple functions (push tokens, preferences, templates, Novu integration), they all serve the main purpose of sending and managing notifications. Organizing into a single epic helps:

- **Consistency**: Ensure all parts of the service are developed synchronously
- **Incremental Delivery**: Stories are arranged in priority order for incremental deployment
- **Clear Dependencies**: Easy to manage dependencies between stories
- **Brownfield Integration**: Focus on integration with existing system (RabbitMQ, Auth Service)

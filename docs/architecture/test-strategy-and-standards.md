# Test Strategy and Standards

Based on the selected tech stack and requirements from PRD, I will define comprehensive test strategy for Notification Service.

### Testing Philosophy

- **Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) for domain logic, test-after for infrastructure
- **Coverage Goals:** 80% overall coverage, 90% domain layer coverage
- **Test Pyramid:** 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% e2e tests

### Test Types and Organization

#### Unit Tests

- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support
- **File Convention:** `*.spec.ts` for unit tests, co-located with source files
- **Location:** Mirror source structure in `test/unit/` directory
- **Mocking Library:** Jest built-in mocking with custom mocks for external services
- **Coverage Requirement:** 80% minimum, 90% for domain layer

**AI Agent Requirements:**

- Generate tests for all public methods
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock all external dependencies (Novu, Auth Service, RabbitMQ)

#### Integration Tests

- **Scope:** Database operations, external service integrations, message queue processing
- **Location:** `test/integration/` directory
- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - **MongoDB:** Testcontainers MongoDB for isolated database testing
  - **Redis:** Embedded Redis server for cache testing
  - **RabbitMQ:** Testcontainers RabbitMQ for message queue testing
  - **External APIs:** WireMock for Novu and Auth Service API stubbing

#### End-to-End Tests

- **Framework:** Jest with supertest for API testing
- **Scope:** Complete notification flows from RabbitMQ event to Novu delivery
- **Environment:** Docker Compose test environment with all dependencies
- **Test Data:** Factory-generated test data with cleanup after each test

### Test Data Management

- **Strategy:** Factory pattern with builder pattern for complex objects
- **Fixtures:** Static test data in `test/fixtures/` directory
- **Factories:** Dynamic test data generation in `test/factories/` directory
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup after each test with database truncation

### Continuous Testing

- **CI Integration:** Jest test runner in Coolify build pipeline
- **Performance Tests:** Load testing for priority queue system with Artillery
- **Security Tests:** OWASP ZAP integration for API security testing

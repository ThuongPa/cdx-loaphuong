# Infrastructure and Deployment

Based on the selected tech stack and requirements from PRD, I will define deployment architecture and practices for Notification Service.

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Docker + Kubernetes + Coolify
- **Location:** `infrastructure/` directory
- **Approach:** Container-first deployment with Kubernetes orchestration and Coolify management

### Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Blue-Green deployment with rolling updates
- **CI/CD Platform:** Coolify with Git integration
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `infrastructure/coolify/coolify.json`

### Environments

- **Development:** Local development with Docker Compose - Development environment with hot reload and debug capabilities
- **Staging:** Kubernetes staging cluster - Pre-production testing environment with production-like configuration
- **Production:** Kubernetes production cluster - Production environment with high availability and monitoring

### Environment Promotion Flow

```
Development → Staging → Production

1. Code committed to main branch
2. Coolify detects changes via Git webhook
3. Automatic build and deployment to staging
4. Staging tests and validation
5. Manual approval for production deployment
6. Blue-green deployment to production
7. Health checks and rollback capability
```

### Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Blue-green deployment with instant rollback capability
- **Trigger Conditions:** Health check failures, error rate > 5%, response time > 2s
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 2 minutes
